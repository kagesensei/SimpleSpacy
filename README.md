# SimpleSpacy
As simple project demonstrating how I use SpaCy NLP for a decision tree to direct the application based on the user's input.  This is akin to the preprocessing I do for GenAI projects I work on.  I can massage the prompt, determine what agents are needed, what RAG or data needs to be queried for context the LLM will use to generate a response.
